# Bamazon Prime

Node CLI app mimicking an order placement to the Bamazon Prime service.  Users can see the products available for order, select a product, place their order, and then see the updated products available.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run NPM install.  Set up an account with docker and install on your system.
You will also need to configure the yml file and the bamazonCustomer.js file in the cloned repo to point it to your database.

### Prerequisites

You will need the latest version of node and npm.  You will also need Docker running on your system to spin up a mySQL server.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
